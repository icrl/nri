<pattern>^ What is six divided by two</pattern>
<template>So. Six divided by two is three. Why would I do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ HOW MUCH PAINT ^</pattern>
<template>So I am looking at how much paint I need for my torso. So what do I do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLICATION ^</pattern>
<template>So I can look at what times two equals six. So what do I do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ DIVISION ^</pattern>
<template>Okay. I can look at the six and two. So what do I do?</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>^ DIVIDE ^ SIX ^ TWO ^</pattern>
<that>SO WHAT DO I DO</that>
<template>Okay. Do I divide six by two? Why do I do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLY ^</pattern>
<that>SO what do I do</that>
<template>I should multiply. Two times three is six. Then what do I do?</template>
</category>

<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>SO WHAT DO I DO</that>
<template>So I'm thinking I should divide six by two but I'm not sure. Why would I do that?</template>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Eighteen is three times more than six</that>
<template>That means my torso is eighteen inches. I am going to <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set>. </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Then what do I do</that>
<template>I'm thinking. So what if I multiply six times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>So what if I multiply six times three</that>
<template>So does that mean my torso has a surface area of eighteen inches? Am I right?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
<that>AM I RIGHT</that>
<template>I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set></template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ NO ^</pattern>
<that>AM I RIGHT</that>
<template>I think I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set> anyway.</template>

<that>AM I RIGHT</that>
<template>I think I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set>.</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ TORSO ^</pattern>
<template>So if I look at how much paint I need for my feet and how much paint I need for my torso. I can figure out how much surface area that is? How do I do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWO ^</pattern>
<template>So two times three is six, right? So I can use that to figure out the answer. How do I do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWELVE ^</pattern>
<template>I'm not sure how the twelve helps. Maybe do something similar but in reverse to what I did in the first step. How do I do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ SIX ^</pattern>
<that>How do I do that</that>
<template>Okay. So I know that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. I have three times as much paint?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWO ^</pattern>
<that>How do I do that</that>
<template>Okay. So I know that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. I have three times as much paint?</template>

</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
<that>I have three times as much paint</that>
<template>So I need three times as much surface area. Should I multiply the surface area of six inches times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ NO ^</pattern>
<that>I have three times as much paint</that>
<template>You don't think I have three times as much paint? And so three times as much surface area? Isn't that what you were telling me?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Is not that what you were telling me</that>
<template>Should I multiply the surface are of six inches times three?</template>

<that>Should I multiply the surface area of six inches times three</that>
<template>Okay. Six times three is eighteen. So is the answer eighteen?</template>

<template>But what do I multiply two by? </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>But what do I multiply two by</that>
<template>I was thinking that if I multiply two by three, that gives us six. Six ounces of paint. So. I have three times as much paint?</template>
