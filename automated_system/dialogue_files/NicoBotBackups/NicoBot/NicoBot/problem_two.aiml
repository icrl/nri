<li>I don't really understand why we're back on step one cause we figured this out. It takes one fluid ounce of paint to cover my arms.</li>
<li>Why are we back on step one for this problem? We already figured out that it is one fluid ounces.</li>
<li>We should go to the next step or problem because I already know how to do this one.</li>
<li>I'm bored. We already did this one.</li>
<li>The answer is one isn't it?</li>
