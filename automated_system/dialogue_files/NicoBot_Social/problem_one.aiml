<li>I thought we figured this one out? It takes four fluid ounces of paints to cover my legs.</li>
<li>Why are we back on step one for this problem? We already figured out that it is four fluid ounces.</li>
<li>We should go to the next step or problem because I already know how to do this one.</li>
<li>I'm bored. We already did this one.</li>
<li>The answer is four isn't it?</li>
