<pattern>^ What is six divided by two</pattern>
<template>Great question! So. Six divided by two is three. Why would we do that?</template>
</category>

    <pattern>^ What is six divided ^ THREE ^ </pattern>
    <template>Great question! So. Six divided by three is two. Why would we do that?</template>
  </category>

  <category>
<pattern>^ HOW MUCH PAINT ^</pattern>
<template>Sweet! So we are looking at how much paint I need for my torso. So what do we do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLICATION ^</pattern>
<template>Sweet! So this is a multiplication problem. So we can look at what times two equals six. So what do we do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ DIVISION ^</pattern>
<template>Okay cool! We can look at the six and two. So what do we do?</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>^ DIVIDE ^ SIX ^ TWO ^</pattern>
<that>SO WHAT DO WE DO</that>
<template>Awesome! Do we divide six by two? Why do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLY ^</pattern>
<that>SO what do we do</that>
<template>Oh yes! We should multiply! Thank you <bot name="username" />. Two times three is six. Then what do we do?</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>SO WHAT DO WE DO</that>
<template>Awesome! So I'm thinking we should divide six by two but I'm not sure. Why would we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>WHY DO WE DO THAT</that>
<template>Aha that makes sense! So. Six divided by two is three. Then what do we do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Why would we do that</that>
<template>Aha that makes sense! So. Six divided by two is three. Then what do we do?</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Eighteen is three times more than six</that>
<template>Hurray! That means my torso is eighteen inches! I am going to <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set>. </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Then what do we do</that>
<template>Okay! I'm thinking. So what if we multiply six times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>So what if we multiply six times three</that>
<template>Wonderful! So does that mean my torso has a surface area of eighteen inches? Am I right?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
<that>AM I RIGHT</that>
<template>Sweet!  I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set></template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ NO ^</pattern>
<that>AM I RIGHT</that>
<template>Really? Are you sure? I think I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set> anyway.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>AM I RIGHT</that>
<template>Yay! I think I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set>.</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>^ TORSO ^</pattern>
<template>Great! So if we look at how much paint we need for my feet and how much paint we need for my torso. We can figure out how much surface area that is? How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWO ^</pattern>
<template>So two times three is six, right? So we can use that to figure out the answer. How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWELVE ^</pattern>
<template>So I'm not sure how the twelve helps us. But it makes sense to do something similar but in reverse to what we did in the first step. How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ SIX ^</pattern>
<that>How do we do that</that>
<template>Oh okay! This is starting to make sense! So we know, I guess, that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. We have three times as much paint?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWO ^</pattern>
<that>How do we do that</that>
<template>Oh okay! This is starting to make sense! So we know, I guess, that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. We have three times as much paint?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ THREE ^</pattern>
<that>How do we do that</that>
<template>Oh okay! This is starting to make sense! So we know, I guess, that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. We have three times as much paint?</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
<that>We have three times as much paint</that>
<template>Sweet! So we need three times as much surface area. Should we multiply the surface area of six inches times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ NO ^</pattern>
<that>We have three times as much paint</that>
<template>Oh? You don't think we have three times as much paint? And so three times as much surface area? Isn't that what you were telling me?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Is not that what you were telling me</that>
<template>Should we multiply the surface are of six inches times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>We have three times as much paint</that>
<template>Sweet! So we need three times as much surface area. Should we multiply the surface area of six inches times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
<that>Should we multiply the surface area of six inches times three</that>
<template>Awesome! Six times three is eighteen. So is the answer eighteen?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ NO ^</pattern>
<that>Should we multiply the surface area of six inches times three</that>
<template>Oh? You don't think we have three times as much paint? And so three times as much surface area? Isn't that what you were telling me?</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ VOLUME ^</pattern>
<template>Sweet! So we know the volume of paint for my torso but we need the surface area. What do we do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ FEET ^</pattern>
<template>Okay! Lets start with my feet! To figure out how big my torso is. We can look at how much paint we need for my feet. What do we do?</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>^ SIX ^</pattern>
<that>What do we do</that>
<template>Oh okay! This is starting to make sense! So we know, I guess, that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. We have three times as much paint?</template>

<pattern>^ TWO ^</pattern>
<that>What do we do</that>
<template>Oh okay! This is starting to make sense! So we know, I guess, that two goes into six three times. Does that mean. We have three times as much paint?</template>

<pattern>^ DIVIDE ^ SIX ^ FOUR ^</pattern>
<template>Are you saying divide the six by four? That seems complicated.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLY ^ TWO ^</pattern>
<template>Good point! But what do we multiply two by? </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>But what do we multiply two by</that>
<template>Oh okay! I was thinking that if we multiply two by three, that gives us six. Six ounces of paint. So. We have three times as much paint?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MEASURE ^</pattern>
<template>Measure my torso? We should use math!</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ DIVIDE ^ SIX ^ TWO ^</pattern>
<template>Right on! So we divide six by two? Why do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLY ^ SIX ^ THREE </pattern>
<template>Aha! If we multiply six times three, that's eighteen. Why do we multiply six times three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Why do we multiply six times three</that>
<template>Oh brilliant! I get it. So we have three times as much paint so then we need three times as much surface area. Which is eighteen! I will <set name="topic">put the answer is eighteen</set>.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ ANSWER ^ EIGHTEEN ^</pattern>
<template>Sweet! The surface area of my torso is eighteen square inches. Can you explain a little bit more about why though?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>YES</pattern>
<that>Can you explain a little bit more about why though</that>
<template>Awesome! I'm listening.</template>

<category>
<pattern>DO YOU NOT KNOW</pattern>
<template>I really don't know! Maybe we start by dividing six by three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>I AM NOT YES</pattern>
<template>Me either! Maybe we look at the six and the two?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>I DO NOT KNOW</pattern>
