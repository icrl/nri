<pattern>^ SIX ^ TIMES ^ TWELVE ^</pattern>
<template>Good hint! So two times six is twelve. Then what do we do?</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ DIVIDE TWELVE BY SIX ^</pattern>
<template>Sounds great! So we divide twelve by six?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWELVE ^ SIX ^</pattern>
<template>Okay sounds great, <bot name="username" />! So we divide twelve by six?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
<that>So we divide twelve by six</that>
<template>Nice! Why do we divide twelve by six?</template>

<that>Why do we divide twelve by six</that>
<template>That makes so much sense! So twelve divided by six is two. Then what do we do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWELVE ^</pattern>
<template>So with the twelve. You think we divide twelve? What do we divide it by?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ SIX ^</pattern>
<that>What do we divide it by</that>
<template>That's brilliant! We can divide twelve by six. Do you think that makes sense?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ THREE ^</pattern>
<that>What do we divide it by</that>
<template>Got it! You're on top of this. But can you explain. Why do we divide by three?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Why do we divide by three</that>
<template>Sweet! So if we divide twelve by three, that's four.</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>SO IF WE DIVIDE TWELVE BY THREE, THAT IS FOUR</that>
<template>Nice! So I need four ounces of paint for my legs! I will <set name="topic">put the answer is four</set>.</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ TWO ^</pattern>
<that>I am feeling pretty good about figuring out how much waterproof paint we need</that>
<template>Sweet! So we multiply two times two. That'll give us four. Four is twice of two.</template>

<template>Awesome! Twelve divided by six is two. What do we do next?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ NO ^</pattern>
<that>So we can divide twelve by six</that>
<template>No? So what do we divide? Should we divide the six inches by two ounces of paint</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Should we divide the six inches by two ounces of paint</that>
<template>Okay! That sounds great! So then we have three inches for every one ounce of paint?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>So then we have three inches for every one ounce of paint</that>
<template>This is definitely a different way to do this problem! But smart! So I'm thinking. Is four the answer?</template>

<that>So what do we divide</that>
<template>I get it! But can you explain it more?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>*</pattern>
<that> But can you explain it more</that>
<template>I suppose it could be easy. Twelve is twice of six. So then what is twice of two? Four is twice of two. </template>

<that>Four is twice of two</that>
<template>I'm going to <set name="topic">put the answer is four</set></template>

<category>
<pattern>^ HALF OF ^</pattern>
<template>So you're saying six is half of twelve? So then we can use that with the two how?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>*</pattern>
<that>So then we can use that with the two how</that>
<template>So if six is half of twelve, then two is half of four. Is four the answer?</template>

<template>Awesome! Can you explain what you mean by twice?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>*</pattern>

<pattern>^ HOW MUCH PAINT ^</pattern>
<template>Okay! To figure out how much paint we need for my legs, do we divide?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>To figure out how much paint we need for my legs do we divide </that>
<template>Yes! Twelve divided by six is two. So then <bot name="username" />. What do we do next?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>What do we do next</that>
<template>Oh! okay! I see that. So then do we multiply two by two? We can double the two. Because we doubled the six?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Because we doubled the six</that>
<template>Okay great! So I think my legs need four ounces of paint. Is four the answer?</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ FEET ^</pattern>
<template>Sounds great! To figure out how much paint we need for my legs. We look at. How much paint we need for my feet?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ SURFACE AREA ^</pattern>
<template>Okay! We are going to figure out how much paint we need for my legs. First we look at the surface area of my feet and. How much paint we need for my feet?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ FIGURE ^ VOLUME ^</pattern>
<template>Wonderful! So if we look at the volume of paint for my feet. That's two ounces which covers six square inches?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>How much paint we need for my feet</that>
<template>So we know we need two ounces of paint for six inches of surface area, right? How do we know? How much paint we need for my feet?</template>

<category>
<pattern>^ HALF ^</pattern>
<that>How much paint we need for my feet</that>
<template>So we're saying six is half of twelve? So then we can use that with the two how</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>How much paint we need for my feet</that>
<template>Sweet! If we divide six by two, that's three. So that means we only need one ounce of paint for three square inches?</template>
</category>

<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>So that means we only need one ounce of paint for three square inches</that>
<template>Okay cool! What do we do with that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>What do we do with that?</that>
<template>Right! Okay so. We have 12 inches and we know one ounce of paint covers three inches. So then do we divide twelve by three? </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>So then what do we do</that>
<template>Okay cool! So then do we divide twelve by three? </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>

<pattern>^ RATIO ^ </pattern>
<template>Okay! Sweet! So we look at the ratio of the six to the two. How do we use this ratio?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ DIVIDE ^ TWELVE ^ SIX ^</pattern>
<that>How do we use this ratio</that>
<template>That sounds great! So we divide twelve by six. Twelve divided by six is two! Then do we use the ratio?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ YES ^ </pattern>
<that>Then do we use the ratio</that>
<template>Aha! You are so smart! So we can multiply two times two. Two times two is four. Is the answer four?</template>
