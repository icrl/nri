<category>
<pattern>^ look at ^</pattern>
<template>Okay so now we need to look at how far I go in twelve point five seconds. How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ Step Zero ^</pattern>
<template>Are you saying we should look at step zero again? How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ last time ^</pattern>
<template>Are you saying we should look at what we did last time? How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ using ^ time ^</pattern>
<template>Okay! So can we use time. How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ ratio ^</pattern>
<template>Okay! So we can look at the ratio of the time it takes me to swim? How do we do that?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ onezero feet ^</pattern>
<that>How do we do that</that>
<template>We can use that original ratio of two point five to ten again. Do we multiply again?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ ten ^</pattern>
<that>How do we do that</that>
<template>We can use that original ratio of two point five to ten again. Do we multiply again?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>How do we do that</that>
<template>Okay! That makes sense. So then what do we do?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ last time ^</pattern>
<template>We can use that original ratio of two point five to ten again. Do we multiply again?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ same ^</pattern>
<template>We can use that original ratio of two point five to ten again. Do we multiply again?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Do we multiply again</that>
<template>So we can multiply four times twelve point five, like last time. That's fifty.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ MULTIPLY ^</pattern>
<template>How do you know we multiply?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>How do you know we multiply</that> 
<template>Ah okay! I think I get it! So we can multiply four times twelve point five, like last time. That's fifty.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>THAT IS fivezero</that> 
<template>Sweet! I will put the answer is fifty.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>WHAT IS FOUR TIMES TWELVE POINT FIVE</pattern>
<template>Four times twelve point five? That's fifty.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>WHAT IS FOUR ^</pattern>
<template>Four times twelve point five? That's fifty.</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>^ over onezero ^</pattern>
<template>So I swam ten feet in two point five seconds. We set the ratio up last time. Do we multiply again?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Can you explain why we multiply by four again</that>
<template>I think I get it! Thank you! So then. I think the answer is twenty nine point two?</template>
</category>


<category>
<pattern>^ ANSWER ^</pattern>
<template>Great!  I will put the answer is fifty.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ DIVIDE ^</pattern>
<template>Okay so to figure out the distance I have swum we need to divide? What do we divide?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ one ^</pattern>
<that>What do we divide</that>
<template>Okay so are you saying we can divide by one? </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>What do we divide</that>
<template>I think I get it. Is the answer fifty?</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>_</pattern>
<that>Is the answer fifty</that>
<template>Great!  I will put the answer is fifty.</template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ step zero ^</pattern>
<that>What do we divide</that>
<template>Okay so divide two point five by ten? That is one quarter or one over four. </template>
</category>

<category>
<pattern>^ onezero ^</pattern>
<that>What do we divide</that>
<template>Okay so divide two point five by ten? That is one quarter or one over four. </template>
