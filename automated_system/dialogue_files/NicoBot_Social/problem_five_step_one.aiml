<template>Sweet! So in order to figure out how far I can swim in seven point three seconds. We need to look at how far I went in two point five seconds? Maybe setup a ratio? How do we do that?</template>

<template>Decimals again! Definitely not my fave! But I guess we can make a ratio of two point five over ten equal to seven point three? How do we do that?</template>

    <template>Sounds great <bot name="username" />! But I'm still learning. I'm not sure how to make the ratio!</template>

    <template>Ohhhh okay! So I guess. We can put two point five over ten equals seven point three? </template>

    <template>Terrific! That's excellent. We can simplify the ratio by reducing two point five over ten? How does that work?</template>

  <category>

    <that>That is cool</that>
    <template>These decimals. Goodness! With the simplified ratio mulitplying is easier! I am guessing we multiply four times seven point three?</template>

  <category>
    <pattern>^ YES ^</pattern>
    <that>I am guessing we multiply four times seven point three</that>
    <template>Hurray! We were right! Seven point three times four is twenty nine point two. That is about as far as my ratio knowledge goes. What do we do next? </template>

    <that>What do we do next</that>
    <template>Right on! So we are going to divide by one. I get it! Because we cross multiplied?</template>
