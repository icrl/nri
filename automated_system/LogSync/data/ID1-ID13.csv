1431,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:21,1,3,3,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,"So for STEP THREE OF THIS THIRD PROBLEM, I may be getting this but can you give me another hint?"
1432,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:21,1,3,3,user,statement,50,1,49,none,,,so in 1 hour you can drive 60 miles so you have to go you drove for 7 hours so if you do 7 * 60 what would you get as your answer for miles
1433,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:21,1,3,3,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,So on the table it will have been 7 hours of traveling. How do we use the seven to get the number of miles?
1434,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:21,1,3,3,user,statement,50,1,49,none,,,so one hour equals 60 miles so if you drove 7 hours and you have to do 7 * 60 to figure out your answer for distance in miles
1435,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:21,1,3,3,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,What do we do with the seven?
1436,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:22,1,3,3,user,statement,50,1,49,none,,,you multiply the 7 x 60 to figure out how many miles you travel
1437,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:22,1,3,3,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Oh okay. We MULTIPLY! Do we MULTIPLY sixty times seven?
1438,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:22,1,3,3,user,statement,50,1,49,none,,,yes you do
1439,7_150817,8/15/2017 18:22,1,3,3,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,So that's four hundred and twenty. Is four hundred and twenty the answer?

1460,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:40,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,silver step to step zero and step one you went up by 6 inches so you have to do that again for Step 2 so what would the answer be
1461,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:40,1,1,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,We can use the ratio of six to two here too? Do we look at how many times two goes into six?
1462,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,no
1463,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Oh okay. So two goes into six three times. How do we figure out how big my torso is?
1464,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,two times 61212 * 4 is
1465,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,So two times three is six. So we can use that to figure out the answer? How do we do that?
1466,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,by multiplying
1467,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Ah okay. So then I know that two goes into six three times. So I can multiply six times three?
1468,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,no
1469,13_160917,9/16/2017 10:41,1,1,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Six times three is eighteen. So is the answer eighteen?
