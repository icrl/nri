683,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:07,1,1,2,,50,0,1,step1_2,0,
684,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:07,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,okay so you're going to divide 20 by 4
685,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:08,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep you're going to divide 20 by 4 and then that gives you 5
686,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:08,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so then 3 * 5 is 15
687,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:08,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,and that's your answer
688,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:08,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep the answer is 15
689,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:09,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
690,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:10,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yes I first step when you're going to divide 12 by 4
691,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:10,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,and then what is 12 divided by 4
692,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:11,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,what is 12 divided by 4
693,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:14,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,what is 12 divided by 4
694,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:15,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,okay so to solve this you have to figure out what to multiply 3 by
695,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:15,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so in order to do that you gotta multiply 3 by 5 mean 3 by 3
696,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:15,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so you're anyone in multiply 3 times 3 and that gives you 9
697,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:15,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so what is the answer
698,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:15,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,what is the answer
699,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:15,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,0,yes 9 is the answer
700,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:18,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
701,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:18,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yeah so for Step 1 you're going to divide 12 by 4
702,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:18,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yes and that's going to give you 3 and then you'll multiply 3 x 3 to get 9
703,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:18,1,1,1,,50,2,1,none,0,transcript empty or null
704,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:18,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,9
705,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so what is the answer Nico
706,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,9 is the answer
707,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,0,yep it is
708,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,2,,50,0,1,step1_2,0,
709,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so for step two we're going to do the same thing only this time we're going to divide 20 by 4
710,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep and then what is that give you
711,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,Nicorette gives you a
712,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:19,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,divided by 4 gives you 5
713,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:20,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so what is the answer then
714,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:20,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep the answer is 15
715,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:25,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
716,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:25,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so first step when you're going to divide 12 by 4
717,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:26,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
718,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:26,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so for Step 1 you're going to divide 12 by 4
719,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yeah and then that will give you three so you can multiply 3 x 3 to get 9
720,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep and that will give you 9 which is the answer
721,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so what is the answer
722,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep that's it
723,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step1_2,0,
724,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so for Step 2 you're going to do the same thing you're going to divide 20 by 4
725,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,yep and what is 20 divided by 4
726,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:27,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,what is 20 divided
727,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:28,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,20 divided by 4 is 5
728,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:28,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,20 divided by 4 is 5
729,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:28,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so then three times 5 is what
730,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:28,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,we multiply it by 5
731,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:28,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,we multiply 3 by 5
732,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:29,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,set 3 * 5 is 15 and 15 is your answer
733,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:29,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,first step to yes
734,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:29,1,1,2,statement,50,1,49,none,0,nice job Nico
735,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:29,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,I said nice job
736,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:32,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
737,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:32,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so if your step when you're going to divide 12 by 4
738,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:32,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep and then that will give you 3
739,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,can multiply 3 x 3
740,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,well that's because you interrupted me
741,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,going to multiply 3 x 3
742,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so what is the answer
743,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yep 9 is the answer
744,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step1_2,0,
745,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so for Step 2 you're going to do the same thing and we're going to divide 20 by 4
746,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,yep and that will give us 5
747,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:33,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,and then we can multiply 3 x 5
748,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:34,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,I said we multiply 3 x 5
749,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:34,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,and that gives us 15 which is the answer
750,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:34,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,first step to yes that's the answer
751,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:34,1,1,2,statement,50,1,49,none,0,yep
752,nlubold   ,7/5/2017 17:34,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,nice job Nico
753,nlubold   ,7/14/2017 12:46,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
754,nlubold   ,7/14/2017 12:46,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yes so look at the relationship between the 6 and the two
755,nlubold   ,7/14/2017 12:47,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so you're going to divide 12 by 6
756,nlubold   ,7/14/2017 12:48,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,do you know the answer
