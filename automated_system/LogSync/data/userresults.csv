1420,nlubold,8/8/17 18:42,1,1,0,,50,0,1,hello nico start,0,HELLO FIRST TIME
1421,nlubold,8/8/17 18:42,1,1,0,statement,50,1,1,none,0,Oscar
1422,nlubold,8/8/17 18:43,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
1423,nlubold,8/8/17 18:44,1,1,1,,50,0,1,null,1,Triggered Speech 1
1424,nlubold,8/8/17 18:44,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so right now we're going to be finding the surface area of your legs
1425,nlubold,8/8/17 18:45,1,1,1,,50,0,1,null,1,Triggered Speech 1
1426,nlubold,8/8/17 18:45,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,image of so we're going to be finding the surface area to cover up the volume of paint with waterproof case you can go swimming and we need to find out how much volume of pain we need to cover up the surface area with a likes
1427,nlubold,8/8/17 18:46,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to be finding the surface area of your legs since we already know that we're going to find the volume of paint we need to cover up your legs which are 12 inches
1428,nlubold,8/8/17 18:46,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so right now we're going to find out since we covered up your feet which were 6 surface area on which surface area was square inches recovered up volume of paint was 2 fluid ounces
1429,nlubold,8/8/17 18:47,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so the volume of paint we used to cover up the the surface area of your feet was 2 fluid ounces and the surface area of your feet or 6 in square inches
1430,nlubold,8/8/17 18:47,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,solder me finding out the fluid the fluid ounces of the paint which we covered up the 6 squared inches of your feet now we're going to do is multiply 6 * 2 + 2 * what Nico
1431,nlubold,8/8/17 18:48,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so we're going to be finding the volume of paint which is fluid ounces we used to to cover up your feet which was 6 squared inches and your legs are 12 square inches so where the volume of paint we're going to be using since 6 inches were doubled with your legs
1432,nlubold,8/8/17 18:48,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we need to double up the surface area of your square inches off your feet which were six inches when you had double that up
1433,nlubold,8/8/17 18:48,1,1,2,,50,0,1,step_1_2,1,
1434,nlubold,8/8/17 18:49,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,since your surface area of was on your legs worth 12 in square or Square
1435,nlubold,8/8/17 18:49,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so since your legs were 12 square inches
1436,nlubold,8/8/17 18:50,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so since your surface area of where 12 of your legs were 12 square inches and the volume of paint will use to paint yourself or six fluid ounces how much do you think the surface area on squared inches will be since we doubled up the 4 fluid ounces on your legs how much you think that how much do you think it will be doubled up at 12 square inches
1437,nlubold,8/8/17 18:50,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,Club thing is we're going to x 3 since since since to 2 times 3 equals 6 then 12 with double that up and we'll reach
1438,nlubold,8/8/17 18:50,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,no
1439,nlubold,8/8/17 18:51,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,well since the surface area of your legs were 12 how much do you think the surface area over torso will be since we covered up six fluid ounces of the paint and 12
1440,nlubold,8/8/17 18:51,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,yes yes
1441,nlubold,8/8/17 18:51,1,1,2,statement,50,1,1,none,1,and then
1442,nlubold,8/8/17 18:52,1,1,1,,50,0,1,step_2_1,1,
1443,nlubold,8/8/17 18:52,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,okay Niko sense
1444,nlubold,8/8/17 18:52,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,okay Niko
1445,nlubold,8/8/17 18:53,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to
1446,nlubold,8/8/17 18:53,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we're going to multiply 2 times 4 times 2 I mean since we multiplied 6 x 2 to get the surface area of your legs we're going to do the same thing with the fluid ounces of the paint we're going to be covering
1447,nlubold,8/8/17 18:53,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,no we multiply 2 by 2
1448,nlubold,8/8/17 18:53,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to multiply two by two
1449,nlubold,8/8/17 18:54,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,no
1450,nlubold,8/8/17 18:54,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so we're basically going to do is multiply 2 by 2
1451,nlubold,8/8/17 18:54,1,1,2,,50,0,1,step_1_2,1,
1452,nlubold,8/8/17 18:54,1,1,1,,50,0,1,step_2_1,1,
1453,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we're going to be multiplying to fluid ounces by 2 because we did the same thing with the 6 squared inches of your feet by 2 which God is 12 so we're going to do to fluid ounces x 2
1454,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,no
1455,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so we're basically going to do is multiply 2 by 2 which would get us
1456,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,yes
1457,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,yes
1458,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,1,good job
1459,nlubold,8/8/17 18:55,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,1,
1460,nlubold,8/8/17 18:56,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,don't worry I'll help you
1461,nlubold,8/8/17 18:56,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,Sony Co what it what is 2 times what equals 6
1462,nlubold,8/8/17 18:56,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,no
1463,nlubold,8/8/17 18:57,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,no Neko
1464,nlubold,8/8/17 18:57,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so we're going to multiply 2 X 3 which equals what
1465,nlubold,8/8/17 18:57,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,Destiny Co
1466,nlubold,8/8/17 18:57,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,we are going to multiply
1467,nlubold,8/8/17 18:58,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so where we going to be doing is multiplying 6 by 3 since that's what we got for fluid ounces we're going to multiply by 3 to get the answer for the square inches of your torso
1468,nlubold,8/8/17 18:58,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,you're going to * 3
1469,nlubold,8/8/17 18:58,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,we are going to x 3
1470,nlubold,8/8/17 18:59,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so the reason we're going to be multiplying by 3 4 6 is because two times 3 equals 6 and that's that's the answer for fluid ounces and then to find the square inches of your torso in a multiply three because that's how much we would multiply because 4 * 3 + 12 * 3 + 606 * 3 equals what
1471,nlubold,8/8/17 18:59,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,no
1472,nlubold,8/8/17 18:59,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,we do not divide 6
1473,nlubold,8/8/17 18:59,1,2,2,,50,0,49,problem_1_2,1,
1474,nlubold,8/8/17 19:01,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,okay me go for this
1475,nlubold,8/8/17 19:01,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,Sonoco for this problem we're going to be doing 6 since we got three for your three squared inches for your arms we're going to divide 6 by 6 by 2 and divide that by 2 and then we going to get we're going to get 3
1476,nlubold,8/8/17 19:01,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we divided by 2
1477,nlubold,8/8/17 19:01,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,divided by 2
1478,nlubold,8/8/17 19:01,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to divide the number two by two
1479,nlubold,8/8/17 19:02,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to divide 2 by 2 which is going to give us what answer
1480,nlubold,8/8/17 19:02,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we're going to ride number the number 2 with
1481,nlubold,8/8/17 19:02,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to divide the number two by two
1482,nlubold,8/8/17 19:02,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,yes
1483,nlubold,8/8/17 19:02,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so that is the answer

1496,nlubold,8/8/17 19:05,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,Sonoco what is 1 times 25
1497,nlubold,8/8/17 19:05,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so Niko since you drove 6
1498,nlubold,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so since you drove 60 miles in 2.5 hours
1499,nlubold,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so 1 times what equals 2.5
1500,nlubold,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we multiply 1 x 2.5
1501,nlubold,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we are going to multiply 1 x 2.5
1502,nlubold,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,we multiply 1
1503,nlubold,8/8/17 19:07,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,well since $0.01 1 * 2.5 is 2.5 and we have 60 miles you drove in 1 hour what we were going to multiply 60 x 2.5
1504,nlubold,8/8/17 19:07,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,yes

1507,nlubold,8/8/17 19:08,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so 150 times 2 which was your mileage at 2.5 hours
1508,nlubold,8/8/17 19:08,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,4 first step is multiplying 150 x 2 because that's how we going to get
1509,nlubold,8/8/17 19:09,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,is 450 * 2 equals 300 then 2.5 * 2 equals what
1510,nlubold,8/8/17 19:09,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,we are going to multiply 2.5 x 2 because that is the same number we multiplied your miles which
1511,nlubold,8/8/17 19:09,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,we multiply 2.5 x 2
