1872,09_210817,8/21/17 18:35,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,yes I am thinking
1873,09_210817,8/21/17 18:35,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,okay so how I did it is multiplied
1874,09_210817,8/21/17 18:36,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so the first step would be multiplying 2 by 3 what do you think that is
1875,09_210817,8/21/17 18:36,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,he * 3 3
1876,09_210817,8/21/17 18:36,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,he * 3
1877,09_210817,8/21/17 18:37,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so are we doing two is * 3 + 2 * 3 would be 6
1878,09_210817,8/21/17 18:37,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,but you can't do it that way or you can't do it either way to * 3 + 3 * 10
1879,09_210817,8/21/17 18:37,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,closed but it's not
1880,09_210817,8/21/17 18:38,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,1,okay so the next step is multiplying
1881,09_210817,8/21/17 18:38,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,1,okay so the next step is multiplying 4 * 3
1882,09_210817,8/21/17 18:38,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,1,
1883,09_210817,8/21/17 18:39,1,1,2,,50,0,33,null,2,Triggered Speech 2
1884,09_210817,8/21/17 18:39,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,cake stuff for the next step you would also multiplies so you would multiply 6 x 3
1885,09_210817,8/21/17 18:40,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,no we are multiplying 6 x 3 which would be 18
1886,09_210817,8/21/17 18:40,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,no we are multiplying 6 x 3 which would be 18 so answer is 18

1888,09_210817,8/21/17 18:40,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,okay so we multiply 6 x 3 which would be 18 so your answer Fitness step would be 18
1889,09_210817,8/21/17 18:41,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,we can like how many times three cousin VI
1890,09_210817,8/21/17 18:41,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,so we figure it out by doing six times 3 which would be taking 6 3 times so basically 6 + 6 + 6
1891,09_210817,8/21/17 18:41,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,so we figure it out by doing six times
1892,09_210817,8/21/17 18:41,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,okay so you would multiply 6 times 3 which is basically 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 or 6 times three would be 18 the answer is 18 for the steps
1893,09_210817,8/21/17 18:42,1,2,2,,50,0,33,problem_1_2,2,
1894,09_210817,8/21/17 18:42,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,okay so this one is the same as the last one except for doing different numbers sort of bed still * 3

2351,12_130917,9/13/17 16:22,1,1,0,,50,0,1,hello nico start,0,HELLO FIRST TIME
2352,12_130917,9/13/17 16:22,1,1,0,statement,50,1,1,none,0,my name is Ana Lucia
2353,12_130917,9/13/17 16:22,1,1,0,,50,0,1,problem start,0,problem start
2354,12_130917,9/13/17 16:23,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,augustaville I do it says surface area for 6 and volume of paint to that's going to help you so then will you you can see that 6/3 would equal to write
2355,12_130917,9/13/17 16:23,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,okay so now it's need to find out what's 12 / 3
2356,12_130917,9/13/17 16:24,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,no you need some now for surface area you do 12/3 which would eat
2357,12_130917,9/13/17 16:24,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,yes you would do tones invited by 3
2358,12_130917,9/13/17 16:24,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,I assume we know that 6/3 too so now we know that each number has to be divided by 3 to do the volume paint so what's 12 / 3
2359,12_130917,9/13/17 16:25,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,do you know 2/3 Nico
2360,12_130917,9/13/17 16:25,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,don't do anything with it we just do it when your snow that 6/3 is too so first step number one since Subzero would be 6 / 3 is too for Step 1 you do 12 / 3
2361,12_130917,9/13/17 16:25,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,we do 12 /
2362,12_130917,9/13/17 16:25,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,do you know what times divided by 3 is
2363,12_130917,9/13/17 16:25,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,0,good job
2364,12_130917,9/13/17 16:26,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,0,okay so for step number two It's the Great and in the volume of paint at 6
2365,12_130917,9/13/17 16:26,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,0,footsie so we know I have to divide the blank divided by three weeks equals 606 times what would equal 8
2366,12_130917,9/13/17 16:26,1,1,1,statement,50,1,33,none,0,play the Doom who have to find out what six-time
2367,12_130917,9/13/17 16:26,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,0,
2368,12_130917,9/13/17 16:26,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,0,
2369,12_130917,9/13/17 16:26,1,1,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,0,
2370,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,yes I will give you hit so what you do we already know that will have to divide the gray space / 3 right
2371,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,okay so it's just like step number one you know that 12/3 is for so we'll have to do it on reverse 6 times what equals so will you do 6 times 3
2372,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,yeah surface area would be 18 yes
2373,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,,50,0,49,null,1,Triggered Speech 1
2374,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,,50,0,49,null,1,Triggered Speech 1
2375,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,2,2,,50,0,49,problem_1_2,1,
2376,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,okay so if you look at 6:04 an example we know that 6/3 is too right
2377,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,well kind of
2378,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,correct there so we not 3/3 is is
2379,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,,50,0,1,null,2,Triggered Speech 2
2380,12_130917,9/13/17 16:29,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,no you do 3/3 like you said
2381,12_130917,9/13/17 16:29,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,yes
2382,12_130917,9/13/17 16:29,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,so for step number one like you said we would do 3/3
2383,12_130917,9/13/17 16:29,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,yes what would be the answer
2384,12_130917,9/13/17 16:29,1,2,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,2,
2385,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,okay so what we would do we would have to be do it says right here blank is surface area and then three is volume
2386,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,so we know how to divide surface area / 3 to equal 3
2387,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,yeah so 3 x 3 would equal
2388,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,yes
2389,12_130917,9/13/17 16:31,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,yes the answer would be 9
2390,12_130917,9/13/17 16:31,1,3,2,,50,0,49,problem_2_3,2,
2391,12_130917,9/13/17 16:31,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,yes
2392,12_130917,9/13/17 16:32,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,but C470 it says time which is 1 and distance is 16 so we would do 60 times we would do 1.1 x 2.5
2393,12_130917,9/13/17 16:33,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,yes
2394,12_130917,9/13/17 16:33,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,2,yes
2395,12_130917,9/13/17 16:33,1,3,2,,50,0,33,step_1_2,2,
2396,12_130917,9/13/17 16:34,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,okay so $0.04 number to we have blank we have we don't know what the time is but we do know that the distance would be the distant IS300
2397,12_130917,9/13/17 16:34,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,so the way we would get to answer 300 is by multiplying two numbers
2398,12_130917,9/13/17 16:34,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,2,yes
2399,12_130917,9/13/17 16:34,1,3,3,,50,0,49,step_2_3,2,
2400,12_130917,9/13/17 16:34,1,3,3,statement,50,1,49,none,2,yes I'll give you the next 10
2401,12_130917,9/13/17 16:35,1,3,3,statement,50,1,49,none,2,okay so we know the time or ours is 7 but we don't know the distance right
2402,12_130917,9/13/17 16:35,1,3,3,statement,50,1,49,none,2,we would do 60 times 7
2403,12_130917,9/13/17 16:35,1,3,3,statement,50,1,49,none,2,yes

156,5_080817,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,,so since you drove 60 miles in 2.5 hours
158,5_080817,8/8/17 19:06,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,,so 1 times what equals 2.5

1605,6_110817,8/11/17 18:28,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,to figure out the volume
1606,6_110817,8/11/17 18:29,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,then you need to find the ratio of how many
1607,6_110817,8/11/17 18:29,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,to figure out the amount of paint need

1613,6_110817,8/11/17 18:31,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so if it takes 6 fluid ounces of paint to cover your torso that means that you have to multiply the 6 by 3 because for all the other ones for your pain if you multiply that by 3 it'll be what how many square inches it takes
1614,6_110817,8/11/17 18:32,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,yeah
1615,6_110817,8/11/17 18:32,1,1,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so two goes into 6 three times

1620,6_110817,8/11/17 18:33,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so if you have
1621,6_110817,8/11/17 18:34,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,if you have a service area on your hands for 6 inches and it takes to fluid oz that that's a ratio of
1622,6_110817,8/11/17 18:34,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,divided by 2 and then answer the answer to x 3
1623,6_110817,8/11/17 18:34,1,2,1,statement,50,1,1,none,1,so if it takes

1626,6_110817,8/11/17 18:35,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so you need to do the same thing you just did but in reverse
1627,6_110817,8/11/17 18:35,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,so instead of dividing it by 3 you're doing it the other way around to find the surface area so you need to multiply by 3 instead
1628,6_110817,8/11/17 18:35,1,2,2,statement,50,1,33,none,1,yeah

1777,7_150817,8/15/17 18:12,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so you have 12 inches to cover on your legs
1778,7_150817,8/15/17 18:12,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so if your feet are 6 inches and your legs are 12 inches
1779,7_150817,8/15/17 18:12,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,x 2
1780,7_150817,8/15/17 18:12,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,the number of fluid ounces for your feet you multiply it by 2
1781,7_150817,8/15/17 18:13,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,the find out how much paint you need for your legs and fluid ounces you look at your feet
1782,7_150817,8/15/17 18:13,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,no you multiply 2 x 2
1783,7_150817,8/15/17 18:13,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,show the square area of your feet is 6 inches and the amount of paint you need to cover that is 2 fluid ounces so if your legs are 12 inches then you would need to do to fluid ounces for your feet and then double that so you would do 2 x 2 and to get for
1784,7_150817,8/15/17 18:14,1,1,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,one fluid ounce equals 3 in 3 Square in

2483,13_160917,9/16/17 10:51,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,so Step One is 1 times 10 equals 10
2484,13_160917,9/16/17 10:51,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,in 2.5 hours you x 10 giving you your distance
2485,13_160917,9/16/17 10:51,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,you multiply 2.5 by 10 to get your distance
2486,13_160917,9/16/17 10:51,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,2.5 * 10
2487,13_160917,9/16/17 10:52,1,3,1,statement,50,1,1,none,0,what is 2.5 * 10

2490,13_160917,9/16/17 10:52,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,who do the opposite of what you did on Step 1 you take 35 and you / 10
2491,13_160917,9/16/17 10:53,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,we know that your hours * 10 equals your distance so what is your what is the opposite of that that would be dividing your distance by the same thing we demoted applied to get the hours
2492,13_160917,9/16/17 10:53,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so we have to divide 30 by 10
2493,13_160917,9/16/17 10:53,1,3,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,divide 30 by 10

2499,13_160917,9/16/17 10:55,1,3,3,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so what is 6 * 10
2500,13_160917,9/16/17 10:55,1,3,3,statement,50,1,33,none,0,by multiplying it by 10
2501,13_160917,9/16/17 10:55,1,3,3,statement,50,1,33,none,0,because in one hour you got a distance of 10 miles so if we make if we make it 6 hours cuz you're going to get 10 times as much as 1 hour or six times as much as 1 hour
2502,13_160917,9/16/17 10:56,1,3,3,statement,50,1,33,none,0,by multiplying it by 10

2520,13_160917,9/16/17 11:00,1,4,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,you do the same thing that you do on number one at a March larger scale so you do 5 times the total Eminem's of of number one
2521,13_160917,9/16/17 11:00,1,4,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so you do five times the total number of Eminem's on Step Zero
2522,13_160917,9/16/17 11:00,1,4,2,statement,50,1,33,none,0,so what would be so
