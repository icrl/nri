1713,10_040917,9/4/17 13:33,1,2,2,1,33,no answer,What do we do with the number three?
1714,10_040917,9/4/17 13:33,1,2,2,1,33,no answer,So if we look at the ratio of one to three. Three is three times more. Right?
1715,10_040917,9/4/17 13:33,1,2,2,1,33,no answer,So three times more than three would be nine. So the answer is nine?
1716,10_040917,9/4/17 13:33,1,2,2,1,33,answering,Okay great! So my head has a surface area of nine inches. I will put the answer is nine.

1939,12_130917,9/13/17 16:23,1,1,1,1,1,no answer,Okay. We are going to figure out how much paint I need for my legs. First I look at the surface area of my feet and how much paint I need for my feet?
1940,12_130917,9/13/17 16:23,1,1,1,1,1,no answer,So we know I need two ounces of paint for six inches of surface area. Six divided by three is two. Does that mean I only need one ounce of paint for three square inches?
1941,12_130917,9/13/17 16:24,1,1,1,1,1,no answer,Okay cool. So then do I divide twelve by three?

1956,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,1,33,no answer,Three times six is eighteen. So is the answer eighteen?
1957,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,1,33,answering,Sweet! So that means my torso has a surface area of eighteen inches. I will put the answer is eighteen.

1972,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,1,33,no answer,Do we multiply by three?
1973,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,1,33,no answer,Okay. We have three ounces of paint. So the surface area it can cover is three times three. That is nine. So the answer is nine?
1974,12_130917,9/13/17 16:31,1,2,2,1,33,answering,Okay great! So my head has a surface area of nine inches. I will put the answer is nine.

2108,13_160917,9/16/17 11:00,1,4,2,1,33,no answer,Okay that sounds good.
2109,13_160917,9/16/17 11:01,1,4,2,1,33,no answer,Okay that makes sense.
2110,13_160917,9/16/17 11:01,1,4,2,1,33,no answer,Hmmm. Is the answer five hundred and fifty? Can you explain more about why that is the answer?
2111,13_160917,9/16/17 11:01,1,4,2,1,33,answering,Oh okay! That makes sense. I will put the answer is five hundred and fifty.
2112,13_160917,9/16/17 11:02,1,4,2,1,49,no answer,So I'm a bit like an older person with hard hearing. Can you say that again?
2113,13_160917,9/16/17 11:02,1,4,3,1,49,no answer,"So now if we have seven bags of candy, I think I'm getting this but can you give me another hint?"
2114,13_160917,9/16/17 11:02,1,4,3,1,49,no answer,So we need to know how many M and M's we will have with seven bags of candies. What do we do?
2115,13_160917,9/16/17 11:02,1,4,3,1,49,no answer,Okay! I think I'm getting this! Let me guess. We multiply one hundred and ten times seven?
2116,13_160917,9/16/17 11:03,1,4,3,1,49,no answer,So five times one hundred and ten is five hundred and fifty. And then do we divide by one?
2117,13_160917,9/16/17 11:03,1,4,3,1,49,no answer,I thought we would divide by one! And then the answer is seventy hundred and seventy candies?
2118,13_160917,9/16/17 11:03,1,4,3,1,49,answering,I have a lot of friends so I bet seven bags is what I should get. For seven bags we have seven hundred and seventy candies! I will put the answer is seven hundred and seventy.
2119,13_160917,9/16/17 11:03,1,5,3,1,57,no answer,Thank you for helping me figure out how many total M and M's there are. But I really love blue M and M's. Do you think we could figure out how many blue M and M's we would have for different numbers of bags?
2120,13_160917,9/16/17 11:03,1,5,1,1,1,no answer,So I'm actually not sure what you mean.
2121,13_160917,9/16/17 11:04,1,5,1,1,1,no answer,I'm sorry. I am trying. What do we do?
2122,13_160917,9/16/17 11:04,1,5,1,1,1,no answer,I really like multiplying. Do we multiply two hundred and twenty times eleven?
2123,13_160917,9/16/17 11:04,1,5,1,1,1,no answer,Oh okay. I think then. Do we multiply two hundred and twenty times one?
2124,13_160917,9/16/17 11:04,1,5,1,1,1,no answer,"So two hundred and twenty times one is just itself, two hundred and twenty. So then what do we do next?"
2125,13_160917,9/16/17 11:05,1,5,1,1,1,no answer,So we cross multiplied and now we divide by ten? Two hundred and twenty two divided by ten is twenty two?
2126,13_160917,9/16/17 11:05,1,5,1,1,1,answering,"Wonderful! So out of two hundred and twenty M and M's, twenty two are blue. I will put the answer is twenty two."
