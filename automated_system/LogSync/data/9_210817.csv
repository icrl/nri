579,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,okay so it's just like step number one you know that 12/3 is for so we'll have to do it on reverse 6 times what equals so will you do 6 times 3
580,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Three times six is eighteen. So is the answer eighteen?
581,12_130917,9/13/17 16:27,1,1,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,yeah surface area would be 18 yes

589,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,user,statement,50,1,1,none,,,okay so if you look at 6:04 an example we know that 6/3 is too right
590,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,So we're looking at the ratio between the six and the two?
591,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,user,statement,50,1,1,none,,,well kind of
592,12_130917,9/13/17 16:28,1,2,1,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Oh okay. So six divided by two is three. So then do we divide three by three?

608,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Do we multiply by three?
609,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,so we know how to divide surface area / 3 to equal 3
610,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,nico,,,,,,1,no answer,Do we multiply by three?
611,12_130917,9/13/17 16:30,1,2,2,user,statement,50,1,33,none,,,yeah so 3 x 3 would equal
